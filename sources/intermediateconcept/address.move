/*
When an address is used as an expression the address must be prefixed by the @ character, i.e., @<numerical_value>or @<named_address_identifier>.
Outside of expression contexts, the address may be written without the leading @ character, i.e., <numerical_value> or <named_address_identifier>

let addrx1:address = @0x1; //numerical address example
let addrx2:address = @my_addrx;//named address example
